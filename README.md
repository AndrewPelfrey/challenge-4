# Challenge-4 My Blog

## Description

AS A marketing student
I WANT a personal blog
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences

Given this prompt, I was able to build a webpage from scratch! 

In this challenge, I created a blog page. The page includes a landing page presenting a form for the user to fill out. The landing page also features a theme-switcher button that changes the colors when you click it. If the user skips a field, an alert will pop up telling you to finish filling it out. Once the user fills out the form and clicks submit, it takes you to a new page where the information they put in is dynamically added to the page! There is also a theme switcher and a back button on this page. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this page!

My motivation behind this page is to continue to learn and help build my skills to keep improving! This was a challenging task that took a lot of problem solving and a combination of various skills to complete and i feel much better with my coding skills now than when I started. I feel better about my JavaScript skills and I found this challenge very helpful. 

## Usage

You can use this page to keep track of your thoughts and experiences in an organized and dynamic way!
